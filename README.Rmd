## About

The **jti** package (pronounced 'yeti') is a memory efficient implementaion of the junction tree algorithm (JTA) using the Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter scheme. Why is it memory efficient? Because we use a ![sparse representation](https://github.com/mlindsk/sparta) for the potentials which enable us to handle large and complex graphs where the variables can have an arbitrary large number of levels. The **jti** package is a big part of the software paper ![sparta: Sparse Tables and their Algebra with a View Towards High Dimensional Graphical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03647).

## Installation

Current stable release from CRAN: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("jti")
```

Development version:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mlindsk/jti", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

## Libraries

```{r}
library(jti)
library(igraph)
```

## Setting up the network

```{r}
el <- matrix(c(
  "A", "T",
  "T", "E",
  "S", "L",
  "S", "B",
  "L", "E",
  "E", "X",
  "E", "D",
  "B", "D"),
  nc = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)

g <- igraph::graph_from_edgelist(el)
plot(g)
```

We use the asia data; see the man page `(?asia)`

### Compilation

Checking and conversion

```{r}
cl <- cpt_list(asia, g)
cl
```

Compilation

```{r}
cp <- compile(cl)
cp
# plot(get_graph(cp)) # Should give the same as plot(g)
```

After the network has been compiled, the graph has been triangulated and moralized. Furthermore, all conditional probability tables (CPTs) has been designated to one of the cliques (in the triangulated and moralized graph).

### Example 1: sum-flow without evidence

```{r}
jt1 <- jt(cp)
jt1
plot(jt1)
```
Query probabilities

```{r}
query_belief(jt1, c("E", "L", "T"))
query_belief(jt1, c("B", "D", "E"), type = "joint")
```

It should be noticed, that the above could also have been achieved by

```{r, eval = FALSE}
jt1 <- jt(cp, propagate = "no")
jt1 <- propagate(jt1, prop = "full")
```
That is; it is possible to postpone the actual propagation.

### Example 2: sum-flow with evidence

```{r}
e2  <- c(A = "y", X = "n")
jt2 <- jt(cp, e2) 
query_belief(jt2, c("B", "D", "E"), type = "joint")
```

Notice that, the configuration `(D,E,B) = (y,y,n)` has changed dramatically as a consequence of the evidence. We can get the probability of the evidence:

```{r}
query_evidence(jt2)
```

### Example 3: max-flow without evidence

```{r}
jt3 <- jt(cp, flow = "max")
mpe(jt3)
```

###  Example 4: max-flow with evidence

```{r}
e4  <- c(T = "y", X = "y", D = "y")
jt4 <- jt(cp, e4, flow = "max")
mpe(jt4)

```
Notice, that `T`, `E`, `S`, `B`, `X` and `D` has changed from `"n"` to `"y"` as a consequence of the new evidence `e4`.

###  Example 5: specifying a root node and only collect to save run time

```{r}
cp5 <- compile(cpt_list(asia, g) , root_node = "X")
jt5 <- jt(cp5, propagate = "collect")
```
We can only query from the variables in the root clique now but we have ensured that the node of interest, "X", does indeed live in this clique. The variables are found using `get_clique_root`.

```{r}
query_belief(jt5, get_clique_root(jt5), "joint")
```

##  Example 6: Compiling from a list of conditional probabilities

 * We need a list with CPTs which we extract from the asia2 object
    - the list must be named with child nodes
    - The elements need to be array-like objects

```{r}
cl  <- cpt_list(asia2)
cp6 <- compile(cl)
```
Inspection; see if the graph correspond to the cpts

```{r}
plot(get_graph(cp6)) 
```

This time we specify that no propagation should be performed

```{r}
jt6 <- jt(cp6, propagate = "no")
```

We can now inspect the collecting junction tree and see which cliques are leaves and parents

```{r}
plot(jt6)
get_cliques(jt6)
get_clique_root(jt6)
leaves(jt6)
unlist(parents(jt6))
```

That is;
 - clique 2 is parent of clique 1
 - clique 3 is parent of clique 4 etc.

Next, we send the messages from the leaves to the parents

```{r}
jt6 <- send_messages(jt6)
```
Inspect again

```{r}
plot(jt6)
```

Send the last message to the root and inspect

```{r}
jt6 <- send_messages(jt6)
plot(jt6)
```

The arrows are now reversed and the outwards (distribute) phase begins

```{r}
leaves(jt6)
parents(jt6)
```

Clique 2 (the root) is now a leave and it has 1, 3 and 6 as parents. Finishing the message passing

```{r}
jt6 <- send_messages(jt6)
jt6 <- send_messages(jt6)
```

Queries can now be performed as normal

```{r}
query_belief(jt6, c("either", "tub"), "joint")
```

##  Example 7: Fitting a decomposable model and apply JTA

We use the `ess` package (on CRAN), found at https://github.com/mlindsk/ess, to fit an undirected decomposable graph to data.

```{r}
library(ess)

g7  <- ess::fit_graph(asia, trace = FALSE)
ig7 <- ess::as_igraph(g7)
cp7 <- compile(cpt_list(asia, ig7))
jt7 <- jt(cp7)

query_belief(jt7, get_cliques(jt7)[[4]], type = "joint")
```
