## jti 0.8.2 (2022-01-27)

 * Unity smoothing and unity propagation is now implemented.
 * `jt_binary_ops` breaking api slightly. The algorithm is now much faster though.

## jti 0.8.1 (2021-09-28)

 * `compile` gets a new argumen `initialize_cpts` in order to speed up computations when insertion of evidence at CPT level are of interest.
 * New function `initialize` to initialize an object from `compile` if `initialize_cpts` was set to `FALSE`
 * `pot_list` deprecated. Use `cpt_list` for both BNs and MRFs

## jti 0.8.0 (2021-07-05)

 * `jt_nbinary_ops` more than twice as fast.
 * New constructor `pot_list` for markov random fields which is more efficient and idiomatic
 * If `joint_vars` is specified, the root node is automatically set to the clique where these variables are located. Hence, one only needs to `collect` to query probabilies about these variables
 * If the entered evidence implies inconsistencies, the `jt` algorithm now proceeds assuming a uniform prior distribution
 on the affected tables. In this regard, one can not query the evidence since it has no meaning. The print method flags
 if there are inconsistencies and it can be obtained by `has_inconsistencies`. This new feature means, that `jti` can
 now also be seen as a "machine-learning" algorithm that can be very useful in connection with class-prediction e.g.
 * Because of the many big changes, the version number has bumped from 0.7.1 to 0.8.0

## jti 0.7.1 (2021-05-21)

 * A small bug fixed for working with undirected graphs
 * `new_mpd` renamed to `mpd`. Works on `cpt_list` objects now.
 * `triangulate` method for `cpt_list` objects.
 * A new heuristic, `evidence`, for triangulation.
 * Better performance when inserting evidence in general since redundant information is now removed.
 * New function `jt_binary_ops` for calculating the number of binary operations to perform a full message passing

## jti 0.7.0 (2021-04-03)

 * Evidence can now be entered in the compilation process.
 * Optimized propagation by avoiding all those unity tables. That is, when a message is sent to a unity table no multiplication is performed; the updated potential just becomes the message.
 * A procedure, `mpd` for finding maximal prime decompositions is now include included
 * It is now possible to `triangulate` a graph before compilation in order to investigate the size of the cliques etc.
 * Triangulation is orders of magnitudes faster now.

## jti v0.6.0 (2020-12-16)

 * There was a bug in the creation of the junction tree when calling Kruskals algorithm.
 
 * It is now possible to specify variables of interest in advance, such that we are 
 guaranteed to be able to query the joint pmf of these variables.
 * Some refactoring making compilation much faster. When potentials is assigned to
 a clique we no longer start by creating a unity table and then multiply. This was killing
 the advantage of the sparsity.
 
## jti v0.5.2 (2020-11-24)

 * A new way of entering evidence that is much more robust
 
## jti v0.5.1 (2020-11-13)

 * A more optimal triangulation method has been implemented, which in general leads to faster run time of the **jt** function.
 * Some mis-spelled words fixed

## jti v0.5.0 (2020-11-09)

 * Initial version
